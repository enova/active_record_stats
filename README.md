[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/enova/active_record_stats.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/enova/active_record_stats)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/enova/active_record_stats/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/enova/active_record_stats?branch=master)

Provides Rails, Resque, and Sidekiq integrations for emitting metrics
about ActiveRecord usage to StatsD using Shopify's [statsd-instrument][].

## Installation

As usual:

~~~ruby
gem 'active_record_stats', require: false
~~~

This library assumes that statsd has already been configured, and is
available via the `StatsD` constant.

## Usage

For Rails web request instrumentation, add the following to your
`config/application.rb`:

~~~ruby
require 'active_record_stats/rack_middleware'

module YourApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.middleware.use 'ActiveRecordStats::RackMiddleware'
  end
end
~~~

For Resque job instrumentation, `extend` your job classes like so:

~~~ruby
require 'active_record_stats/resque_plugin'

class SomeJob
  extend ActiveRecordStats::ResquePlugin
end
~~~

For Sidekiq instrumentation, enable the server middleware:

~~~ruby
require 'active_record_stats/sidekiq_server_middleware'

Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  config.server_middleware do |chain|
    chain.add ActiveRecordStats::SidekiqServerMiddleware
  end
end
~~~

## Metric names

Metrics will be with names in the following formats:

1. Gauge db.web._controller_._action_._statement_: the number of `statement` queries
   performed for a given controller action.
2. Timer db.web._controller_._action_.runtime: the total `db_runtime` cost of
   a given controller action, in milliseconds.
3. Gauge db.job._class_._statement_: the number of `statement` queries performed
   for a given job.

As Graphite metric names may not contain a `/` character, they are replaced with
two underscores (`__`). For sanity's sake, the same is done for `::` delimiters.

Example metrics that might be emitted:

* `db.web.v1__widgets.update.UPDATE:2|g`: two `UPDATE` statements were issued
   when processing `V1::WidgetsController#update`.
* `db.web.posts.create.runtime:123|g`: Rails reported the total time spent
   in ActiveRecord for the `PostsController#create` action as 123 ms.
* `db.job.cache__prime.SELECT:10|g`: ten `SELECT` statements were issued when
   processing the `Cache::Prime` job.

## Caveats

This library does not actually parse SQL queries; it uses a [very naive string munging
tactic](https://github.com/enova/active_record_stats/blob/master/spec/statement_type_spec.rb)
to identify the statement type involved. Because of this, some of the metrics are a
bit nonsensical, such as `WITH` statements being reported when a query begins with a CTE.
